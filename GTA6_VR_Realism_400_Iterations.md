## Suggested Execution Loop (per iteration)
1. Define measurable acceptance criteria.
2. Implement feature slice behind a feature flag.
3. Validate in VR ergonomics test pass.
4. Run simulation stress scenarios (AI, traffic, weather, economy).
5. Capture telemetry and adjust balancing constants.
6. Promote to milestone branch after passing regression suite.

## Milestone Exit Criteria
- **Simulation fidelity:** systems remain coherent under 2x load.
- **VR comfort:** locomotion and interaction maintain target comfort thresholds.
- **Narrative continuity:** world state persists credibly across sessions.
- **Technical stability:** no blocking regressions in core loops (driving, crime, police response, economy).
