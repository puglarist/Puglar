# Major Release Patches

## 2026-02 Patch Refresh

### Patch MRP-5.0
- Confirmed and documented the latest doctrine archive as `Puglar_Full_Doctrine_Archive_v5.zip`.
- Marked `Puglar_Full_Doctrine_Archive_v2.zip` as the prior major archive release for downgrade/rollback reference.
- Normalized release tracking in this file so future major patch updates can be appended consistently.

### Patch MRP-2.x Family
- Confirmed the currently available v2 release-line assets:
  - `Puglar_AEN_Attention_Gorilla_Rest_v2_Cards.pdf`
  - `Puglar_Handbook_v2_Language_Guide.pdf`
  - `Puglar_TreeWebs_Handbook_v2_Climb_and_Shade.pdf`
- Added this grouped view to make maintenance patches easier when only the v2 family is revised.

### Patch MRP-Legacy
- Documented legacy major-version assets retained for reference:
  - `Puglar_Omnibus_Final_v1.pdf`
  - `Puglar_Ranger_Awareness_Manual_v4.pdf`

## Patch Management Notes
- Use `MRP-<major>.<patch>` for major-line updates (example: `MRP-5.1`).
- Add a dated section for each new patch cycle.
- Keep superseded assets listed until an archival policy is formally added.
