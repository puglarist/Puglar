# Puglar Feature Expansion Plan (250 Iterations)

A delivery-ready roadmap that turns the 250-feature backlog into execution batches with priorities and measurable outcomes.

## Execution Rules

- **Batching:** Run iterations in 25 waves of 10 items each (Wave 1 = 1-10, Wave 25 = 241-250).
- **Capacity:** Default team capacity is 10-14 points/week; adjust effort labels (S/M/L) accordingly.
- **Definition of done:** Feature shipped, documented, and measured against the KPI target after 2 weeks.
- **Dependencies:** `None` means can begin immediately; otherwise complete listed theme prerequisite first.
