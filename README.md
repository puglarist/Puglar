## GTA 6 Ultra-Realistic VR/WebXR Expansion Pack (Design + Build Blueprint)

This repository now includes a production-oriented design blueprint for a **GTA 6-style** feature set with:

- Ultra graphics pipeline targets (ray tracing, GI, volumetrics, crowd density, weather fidelity)
- Full VR readiness strategy (comfort, interactions, locomotion, haptics)
- WebXR/metaverse integration architecture
- Economy and money systems
- Prison logic + physical prison zones as map content
- Mod menu logic with permission and safety layers

See: **`docs/gta6_vr_metaverse_expansion_blueprint.md`**

> Note: This is a design and technical implementation plan, not Rockstar source code.
