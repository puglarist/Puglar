# Puglar Engine-Style Doctrine Hub

Puglar is now organized like a **game engine project workspace** (inspired by Unreal Engine and Unity) so you can navigate doctrine content quickly, run training loops, and treat each PDF as a reusable system module.

## 🎮 Quick Start (Engine Mindset)

1. **Open the Project Browser** (the file list below).
2. **Pick your scene** (daily training intent).
3. **Load only required modules** (specific PDFs).
4. **Run the loop** (warm-up → drill block → reflection).
5. **Save progress** (notes, cadence, versioned updates).

## 🧠 Unreal/Unity-Style Architecture

### 1) Scene-Based Training Design
Treat each session as a **Scene/Level**:
- **Exploration Scene** → awareness + environmental reads.
- **Movement Scene** → body mechanics + positional transitions.
- **Command Scene** → stances + decision cadence.
- **Endurance Scene** → progressive load and recovery.

### 2) Component-Driven Skill Building
Treat every skill as a **Component** attached to the trainee:
- Perception component
- Posture component
- Locomotion component
- Breath/recovery component
- Command/timing component

Swap components in or out per day, just like toggling gameplay components.

### 3) Gameplay Loop (Fixed Update)
Use a stable runtime loop:
- **Init** (2–5 min): alignment, breath, intent.
- **Tick Block A** (10–20 min): primary drill.
- **Tick Block B** (10–20 min): support drill.
- **Challenge Pass** (5–10 min): pressure/variation.
- **Cooldown + Debrief** (5 min): logging and calibration.

### 4) Difficulty Curves (Progression System)
Scale like game difficulty tiers:
- **Tier 1**: static, precise, low fatigue.
- **Tier 2**: dynamic transitions, moderate fatigue.
- **Tier 3**: mixed conditions, cognitive load, time pressure.

### 5) Build Targets (Platform Thinking)
Choose the format by context:
- **Desktop build** = full handbook study.
- **Mobile build** = pocket cards.
- **Field build** = waterproof / laminated cards.

## 📅 Suggested Weekly Runtime Scheduler

- **Mon**: Awareness + TreeWebs
- **Tue**: Physical doctrine + stance chain
- **Wed**: Command cards + micro cards
- **Thu**: Iron Cross mechanics
- **Fri**: Scenario mix (all systems)
- **Sat**: Youth/family adaptation or coaching
- **Sun**: Recovery + doctrine review

## 🛠️ Maintainer Notes (Unity/Unreal-Like Workflow)

When adding new assets:
1. Keep naming versioned (`vX`) for deterministic updates.
2. Place the file in the repository root unless a folder structure is introduced.
3. Update this README "Project Browser" so the registry stays authoritative.
4. Prefer additive updates over replacing prior doctrine versions.

## Vision

Puglar is treated as a **living engine project**: doctrine as data, drills as systems, sessions as scenes, and progression as iterative builds.
