This repository now includes a production-oriented Prisma schema for a multiplayer metaverse/game-engine backend with:

- VR + WebXR aware player/device capability modeling
- Realm/lobby/session orchestration for Fortnite-like and tactical realism modes
- Modding pipeline entities for packages, versions, scripts, blueprints, and quest graphs
- Workload + telemetry + crash observability models for live debugging at scale
- Moderation, issue tracking, and communication entities for community operations

See:

- `prisma/schema.prisma` for the full data model
- `docs/prisma-iteration-log.md` for the 140-pass refinement log
