# Puglar

Puglar now includes a serious Prisma foundation for a creator-first multiplayer game platform with VR/WebXR support.

## What's modeled

- Identity and safety: users, profiles, device trust and anti-cheat signals
- Live realms: realm ownership, memberships, map revisions, world partition cells, replication rules
- Match runtime: lobbies, participants, build pinning, voice transport, realism presets
- Mod ecosystem: packages, versions, contributors, script governance, blueprint + quest assets
- Gameplay systems: loadouts, ability bindings, inventories, leaderboard seasons/entries
- XR performance: scene profiles and workload snapshots including frame/pacing telemetry
- Operations: telemetry events, crash reports, issue tickets, moderation actions, and chat retention
