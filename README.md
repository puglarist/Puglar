## GTA 6 iteration simulator

This repo includes a simulator that iterates **all 500 steps** over:

- GTA-style game logic
- graphics quality
- booty-shaking animation effects
- performance stability

It now prints a **full 500-line iteration trace** plus final scores.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 gta6_iteration_sim.py
```
