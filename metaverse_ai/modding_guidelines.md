# GTA / MW2 Modding & Server Guidance

Use this stack only for legitimate, server-approved workflows:

1. **GTA worlds (FiveM/alt:V style ecosystems):**
   - Generate map concepts, mission flow, and non-invasive scripts.
   - Package assets with explicit ownership and licensing metadata.
2. **MW2-style logic worlds:**
   - Build private sandbox logic prototypes, not cheat tooling.
   - Keep server-side validation authoritative.
3. **AI agent chat in engine:**
   - Restrict tool permissions (filesystem, shell, network).
   - Log agent actions and require approval for publish/deploy steps.

This keeps the project useful for creative world-building without crossing into
unauthorized reverse engineering or anti-cheat evasion.
