# WebXR Workspace

This folder contains preparation assets and scripts for upcoming WebXR/VR tasks.

## Quick start

From the repository root:

```bash
bash webxr/vr-task/prepare-assets.sh
```

The script creates `webxr/vr-task/staging/` and copies the source doctrine PDFs into
WebXR-friendly, slugged filenames so they are easier to reference in tooling.
