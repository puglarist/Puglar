# Puglar Assets

This folder adds a reusable graphics baseline so the project has ready-to-use visual assets for docs, cards, web, and print workflows.

## What was added

- `graphics/puglar-logo-mark.svg` — icon/crest style mark.
- `graphics/puglar-logo-lockup.svg` — full logo with wordmark.
- `graphics/puglar-badge.svg` — circular badge for covers/stickers.
- `graphics/puglar-field-pattern.svg` — subtle background pattern.

## Usage guidance

- Prefer SVG for any print workflow to preserve vector quality.
- Keep a 24px safe area around the logo mark in layouts.
- Badge and pattern are designed to work over dark backgrounds.
- If raster exports are needed, export from SVG at 2x and 4x scales.
